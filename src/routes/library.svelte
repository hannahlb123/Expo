<h1 class="title">Student Library Team</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="when">When: 30 mins each week whenever suits you</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="where">Where: Rangi Library</h2>
<p>
  The student library team is a team of 15 students from years 11 to 13 who look
  after the library before school, lunchtimes or after school for at least half
  an hour each week. The duties can include: helping with basic library
  functions such as checking out books and returns, recommending resources and
  keeping the library stocked.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  There is no cost associated with the student library team, however, you will
  earn community service hours for your work. You need to love reading, be
  comfortable finding your way around the library, be friendly, positive and
  polite and enjoy helping students as well as having good spoken and written
  English and being comfortable using technology.
