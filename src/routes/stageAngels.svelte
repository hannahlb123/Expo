<p>
  In Stage Angels we are looking to partner with the new Conference Centre
  technical team to give students experience in working our own venues but also
  other theatre venues in schools. We want more women in theatre technology, and
  some of our past and current students work for companies in Christchurch and
  for outside hirers of our venues after school and on the weekends. We give you
  an opportunity to gain the skills to get involved in our productions in an
  offstage capacity.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You need to have an interest in either theatre technologies (lights, sound,
  props, set, costume, etc), being a stagehand or stage manager. It is open to
  all year levels and there is no cost.
