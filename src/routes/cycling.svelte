  Cycling is split into 3 races for the school competition - individual time
  trials where you race as fast as you can against the clock. Team time
  trials is a group of 3 to 4 (5 for nationals) where you race other teams. There is a graded
  scratch where you race in a group of people about your level and it is the
  first person over the finish line who wins. For training you train as a team
  to learn how to do team time trials.
