  Badminton is a game where you hit a shuttlecock over a net to the
  other player. This is played in a team of four, where you play two games each
  week, singles and doubles.

  Uniform is the school PE uniform but you need your own racquet. It is $25 for both
  terms, additional cost if you take the school transport. Generally there are no
  practices, however if your team wants a practise it can be arranged.
