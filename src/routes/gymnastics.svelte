<p>
  Gymnastics is a sport which includes balance, strength, flexibility, agility,
  coordination, and endurance. Artistic gymnastics has 4 events - floor, vault,
  uneven bars and beam. For each event you perform a routine for the judges, who
  will then give you a score.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You will need your own leotard, and the cost is based off what
  competions and transport you choose to enter. This is not a coaching program
  so you have to be doing club gymnastics outside of school.
