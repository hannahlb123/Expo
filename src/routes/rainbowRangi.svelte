  Rainbow Rangi is a group for LGBT people in our Rangi community, as well as
  their straight allies, to come together and discuss the issues in our
  communities, and provide a place where everyone can feel included and
  accepted. Most sessions include baking and food to share.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Rainbow Rangi is open to all year groups and anyone whether you are apart of
  the LGBTQ+ community or just an ally. There is no cost associated with this
  club.
