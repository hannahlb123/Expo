  Rugby is a ball sport with 15 players on each team. The aim of the game is to
  get the ball across the line at the end of the field by tackling people.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  For both rugby and rugby 7's players must have their own boots, shorts, socks and mouth guard. Tops are provided. Cost is approx. $40 per season plus transport. <br><br>

  Commitment to all trainings is vital, particularly for new players to learn safe contact techniques.
